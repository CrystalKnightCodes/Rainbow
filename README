This app worked when I uploaded it.  However, I recently changed my Git Username, and forgot to change it in Xcode when making my commits.  I changed it before I pushed it to Git Hub, and now I'm getting crazy errors that are beyond my current abilities to fix.  Oh well.  I don't plan to make any more name changes, I promise.
